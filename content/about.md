I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. I am very passionate about all things related to cybersecurity, in particular penetration testing. I love to learn on my own and constantly challenge myself. 

Currently looking for work in the cybersecurity industry.
