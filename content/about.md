I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. I am very passionate about all things related to cybersecurity, in particular penetration testing and hardening systems' security (networks, OS, software). I love learning new things and challenging myself through CTFs.

I am currently looking for work in the cybersecurity industry as an entry level penetration tester or security engineer.

When I'm not learning about security, I spend my time surfing, playing guitar and drums, kickboxing and spending quality time with friends. I also like making videos of places I've been to.
