Hello!
I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. I have a strong interest in distributed systems. 

I am currently looking for positions as a software engineer, backend developer or full stack engineer. 

### When I'm not working... 

When I'm not programming or learning about computer related topics, I love to spend my time surfing, playing guitar and drums, kickboxing and spending quality time with friends. I also like making videos of places I've been to.

### Let's have a chat!
I'd love to connect. Feel free to send me an email or connect on LinkedIn.
