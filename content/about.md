I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2022. I am very passionate about all things related to cybersecurity, in particular penetration testing and securing systems (networks, OS, software). I love learning new things and challenging myself. Being able to see yourself grow as a great feeling. 

I am currently looking for work in the cybersecurity industry, preferably as a penetration tester or security engineer.

When I'm not learning about cybersecurity, I like to surf, play guitar and drums, and kickbox. I also love hiking and exploring new places. Also a very, very amateur photographer.

I'd love to connect! Feel free to send me an email or connect on LinkedIn.
