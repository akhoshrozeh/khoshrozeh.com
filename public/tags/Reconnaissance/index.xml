      <description>Introduction In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over some reconnaissance tools, most of them built by well known and respected hacker TomNomNom, or Tom Hudson. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to cover some of his methodologies and techinques, for example how he utilizes VIM in his recon.
You can find and install his tools from his github.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to demonstrate some of these tactics on Admiral Labs which currently has a bug bounty on HackerOne.</description>
