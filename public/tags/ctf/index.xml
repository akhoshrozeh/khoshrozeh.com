      <description>Introduction This CTF looks pretty straightforward based on the questions. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll try and do a speed run on it and do the writeup at the same time.
These are the questions:
What is the Web Directory you found? what is the file name you found? what is the FTP Password? what is the file name with SSH password? user.txt root.txt Let&amp;rsquo;s go!
CTF Directory enumeration: gobuster dir -u http://10.</description>

      <description>Introduction This CTF on TryHackMe has no instructions and only three questions:
What is Weston&amp;rsquo;s password? What&amp;rsquo;s the user flag? What&amp;rsquo;s the root flag? Let&amp;rsquo;s spin up the virtual machine and get hacking.
Break Out the Cage The only clue we start with is there&amp;rsquo;s a person named Weston.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with a TCP SYN port scan to see services are running, as well as gathering the service and OS information.</description>

      <title>CTF Writeup: OWASP Juice Shop</title>

      <description>Introduction This CTF is called &amp;ldquo;OWASP Juice Shop&amp;rdquo; and is on the TryHackMe platform. It focuses on the following security concerns from the OWASP Top 10: Injection, Broken Authentication, Sensitive Data Exposure, Broken Access Control and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Task 1 This is simply spinning up the virtual machine and connecting to it through TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s VPN. It is recommended to be familiar with Burp.
Task 2 We do some basic reconnaissance: just walking the applicaion.</description>

      <title>CTF Writeup: RootMe</title>

      <description>Introduction Here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show how I solved the RootMe CTF on TryHackMe. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be for beginners so let&amp;rsquo;s jump in and find out!
Reconnaissance Weâ€™ll start with nmap to run a TCP SYN scan with some parallelism and collect service version information as well:
sudo nmap -sS -sV --min-parallelism 20 10.10.48.220
Note: we need to run SYN scans with escalated privileges because it is a more stealthy scan than say a TCP Connect scan.</description>
